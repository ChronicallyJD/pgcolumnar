# ---- the coverage runner must refuse a run that captured no counters --------
#
# #740. The nightly coverage job failed every night from the night it was added
# (2026-07-31) and had never measured anything. It runs under sudo, so the build
# is root-owned, while lib.sh runs the server as `postgres` when it is root
# (lib.sh:150). gcov writes each .gcda beside its object, as the process that ran
# the code, so the backend could not create one and `lcov --capture` found
# nothing.
#
# What kept it unexamined for 25 nights was the ORDER of the failure. lcov failing
# on an empty tree reports "capture produced nothing", which reads as a broken
# tool rather than as a permission problem, so nobody looked. run_coverage.sh now
# refuses the run itself, before lcov, and says where the counters should have
# been. That ordering is the thing worth pinning: with the refusal after the
# capture it would be dead code and the misleading message would be back.

# produced nothing" message this guard exists to pre-empt, back again.

# counters" and have different fixes. It did that with `find / -xdev`, and
# -xdev by definition will not cross a mount boundary, while GCOV_PREFIX
# defaults under /tmp -- a separate tmpfs on both boxes this was measured on,
# this project's dev container and the development host. How common that is
# elsewhere I have not measured. Counters sitting exactly where the
# redirect put them are invisible to that walk, so the run reports "nothing
# wrote them" and sends the reader to permissions.
#
# Measured, one file under a tmpfs /tmp and none elsewhere on the root
# filesystem: -xdev found 0, the same walk without it found 1, probing the
# prefix found 1.
#
# So GCOV_PREFIX must be asked BEFORE the tree-wide walk. Asked after, the
# walk's answer wins and the misdiagnosis returns; present but unordered, this

#
# Demonstrated with the loop exactly as it stood, a file planted as `postgres`
# and written by root to a directory outside the tree, then blocked by the
# constraint while a legitimate counter under $SRCDIR/src still copied. Both
# arms, because a containment that refuses everything is not a fix.

# ranked the worst in the tree, four of the named files between 94% and 100%, and
# function rates above 100% on their face. The same command on the same tracefile
# gave correct rows on lcov 2.0-1 and wrong ones on the runner's 2.0-4ubuntu2, so
# the table moved with a distro patch rather than with the data.
#
# A rate is a division of two integers the tracefile states outright, so the fix is
# to do the division. `lcov --summary` keeps its job: it was right on both builds.
#
# THE ARMS DRIVE THE GENERATOR over a synthetic tracefile rather than grepping it.
# A static check that the runner calls the right script cannot tell whether the
