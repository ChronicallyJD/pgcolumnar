# ---- the binary under test must be built from this source, and the server must
# ---- be running it (#432 follow-up, jd)
#
# TWO QUESTIONS, AND THE HARNESS COULD ANSWER NEITHER.
#
# selftest 110 compares the INSTALLED .so against the one built in this tree, so a
# missed install and a foreign overwrite are caught. Nothing derived anything from
# the SOURCE TEXT, so both copies could agree with each other while both were stale
# against edited source. PGC_SKIP_BUILD opens that hole widest, because not
# rebuilding is its entire purpose.
#
# And a cp is not enough. shared_preload_libraries='pgcolumnar' maps the library at
# postmaster start, so `make install` over a running instance changes the file and
# nothing else: every backend keeps executing the code it already mapped. A binary
# can match the source exactly while the server runs something older.
#
# THE CONTROLLER SHAPE. Whoever builds records a fingerprint of the build inputs.
# Every suite in the batch recomputes it and compares, so it is one build per batch
# and one hash per suite rather than a rebuild per suite. Then, once the cluster is
# up, the suite compares the binary's mtime against pg_postmaster_start_time().
#
# The verdict functions are pure, taking their inputs as arguments, for the same
# reason pgc_build_needs_clean is: they can be exercised here without a build.
#
# THE MEASURED COST OF NOT HAVING THIS. A probe run under PGC_SKIP_BUILD=1 asserted
# its fix was "present" by grepping the SOURCE while measuring a .so a different
# worktree had installed. Its control failed, and the failure read as a product
# defect for several minutes.
#
# AND ONE FROM WRITING IT. The first revision wrote the stamp in the skip-build
# branch, so every run recorded the source it was about to compare against and a
# suite measuring an edited tree reported "matches the binary under test". The arm
# below that requires `stale` is what caught it.

#
# on a tree that was correct. The path is tree-RELATIVE and the content fixed, so

# pair: /tmp is a different filesystem from the tree here, so the hardlink copy
# failed AFTER creating DST, and `cp -a` then copied the tree INSIDE it -- the
# copy's build dirs came out as `bfix src` instead of `objstore src`. The PREMISE

# Changing pgc_source_stamp_path from `DIR MAJOR` to `DIR PG_CONFIG` changes a
# CONTRACT, and a contract change is only as good as the sweep that finds every
# caller. @jdatcmd merged the two branches and found the case this misses
# (#903 review): #897 adds a NEW writer inside pgc_build_and_install, and
# `test/lib.sh` conflicts in pgc_setup while that new call site merges CLEANLY
# and is then wrong. The resolution you are shown is not the defect.
#
# What the mismatch costs, measured by driving the real function both ways:
#
#     correct (PG_CONFIG):     /t/.pgc_source_stamp.18.603d6145
#     a major passed instead:  /t/.pgc_source_stamp.0.nolib6f4
#
# `pgc_major_of 18` finds no version in the string "18", so the major becomes 0
# and the id becomes a hash of the literal "18". The writer and the reader then
# address DIFFERENT FILES and never meet, so every suite reports
# "freshness UNVERIFIED" -- and unknown is deliberately not a failure, so
# NOTHING SAYS SO. Worse for the case this file exists for: a key derived from
# the literal "18" is the same for every PG18 prefix, so pg18a, pg18n and
# pg18_san collide again on the writer path.
#
# So this arm is about the CLASS. It reddens for any caller, in any file, that
# passes a major where a pg_config belongs -- including one that arrives through
# a clean merge in a hunk nobody was asked to resolve.

# A FINGERPRINT THAT COULD NOT BE COMPUTED MUST NOT LOOK LIKE ONE THAT WAS.
#
# `$(md5sum < "$f" 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f1)` substitutes an EMPTY digest
# when md5sum fails, so one transient failure -- a fork that hits EAGAIN, an
# OOM kill, a loaded runner -- silently changes the whole hash and the function
# still returns 0. Modelled with a stub md5sum that fails on its Nth call and is
# otherwise the real one, three different confident answers over ONE unchanged
# tree:
#
#     baseline                   c8e6b23db1c9
#     one digest empty (call 2)  22897add806e
#     one digest empty (call 3)  58c76fdab962
#     exit status                0
#
# On #902's PG18 leg a suite reported FATAL "the binary under test was not built
# from this source" against a tree that was correct, and the stamp it disagreed
# with equalled a clean local fingerprint of the same head. Whatever moved, the
# WRITE was right and one READ was not.
#
# The requirement is not that the computation cannot fail. It is that a failure
# is reported as one: EMPTY, which pgc_freshness_verdict already turns into
# `unknown` and the controller already prints as "freshness UNVERIFIED" and
# deliberately does not fail. A false UNVERIFIED costs a line of output. A false
# FATAL costs a red matrix and teaches people to re-run past the check.

# THE MECHANISM HAD TO CHANGE WHEN THE IMPLEMENTATION DID (#907).
#
# This block used to stub `md5sum` on PATH, because the shell forked it once per
# file. The digest is now hashlib inside test/pgc_fingerprint.py, which no PATH
# can reach -- so the stub would have left every arm below GREEN while testing
# nothing at all, which is the precise failure this file exists to refuse.
#
# A real read failure needs a real reader who is denied, and root is denied
# nothing: chmod 000 is invisible to it. Measured before this was written:
#
#     as root      28a7149e07ae   <- reads the mode-000 file regardless
#     as postgres  (empty)        <- the failure these arms need
#
# The tree therefore lives outside any 0700 directory and is read by a second
# user. Where no such user exists the arms SKIP loudly rather than pass quietly:
# a guard that cannot run is not a guard that held.
