"""The corpus must not report on source it never built.

@jdatcmd demonstrated the defect this closes: with
`#error THIS SOURCE IS BROKEN AND CANNOT BUILD` appended to
src/columnar_projection.c and nothing rebuilt,

    pytest                          -> 25 passed, exit 0
    bash test/native_projection.sh  -> FATAL: the build failed ..., exit 1

The bash harness has refused that since #536. This one did not, because it never
built, never installed and never compared anything -- `Cluster.so_md5` printed a
fingerprint that nothing read.

The refusal now comes from `pgc_build_and_install` in test/lib.sh, driven from
Python, so there is one implementation rather than two that can drift.

Two levels of arm here, deliberately. The injected-runner arms pin what the
Python side does with a verdict. The `bash` arms pin the SHELL PLUMBING -- the
sourcing, the quoting and the exit-status path -- which an injected runner
cannot reach and which is where a wrong quote would hide.

WHAT THIS FILE REACHES INTO, AND WHAT IT NO LONGER DOES (#432).

CONTEXT.md's independence rule: the two harnesses are parallel in functionality and
independent in implementation, and a pytest test that drives `test/lib.sh` is the
first measurement wearing a Python wrapper -- it agrees with the shell by
construction and can never report it wrong. This file was the largest item on that
inventory.

The fingerprint and manifest arms no longer go through it. Their subject is
`test/pgc_fingerprint.py`, which has been the ONE implementation since #907;
`pgc_source_fingerprint` and `pgc_source_manifest` in lib.sh are thin wrappers that
shell out to exactly that module, so the old path was
python -> bash -> lib.sh -> python3 -> the module. They call the module now, in
process where the property allows and through the module's own CLI where it needs a
different user or locale. Measured before converting a single arm: the fingerprint is
byte-identical through both paths, the manifest is identical line for line, and both
agree across LC_ALL=C, C.UTF-8 and en_US.UTF-8.

WHAT STILL GOES THROUGH bash, and why each one is not a wrapper to be removed:

  * `pgc_write_source_stamp`, `pgc_source_stamp_path`, `pgc_freshness_report` and
    `pgc_freshness_verdict` are pure shell. They are the shell harness's OWN
    implementation, not a wrapper over shared code, so an arm here is a second
    harness testing the first. Those belong to the shell harness and are the next
    step, not this one.
  * `test_the_two_fingerprint_implementations_cover_the_same_inputs` reaches across
    ON PURPOSE and is the one arm that should. Its subject is that neither side
    carries a private copy, which cannot be expressed without touching both.
    CONTEXT.md's rule allows exactly this -- "say which, and say why" -- so this is
    the saying: it caught four defects in one day (#907), it is the guard that
    reddens on the first edit if a private implementation returns, and the property
    is the relationship rather than either side.
  * `test_the_fix_does_not_rebaseline_stamps_already_on_disk` embeds the PREVIOUS
    shell algorithm as a fixture and compares today's value against it. The fixture
    is a file the test builds itself, which the rule permits, but it calls
    `pgc_source_build_dirs` out of the real lib.sh for its directory list. Feeding it
    the module's own `build_dirs` would make it self-contained; that is a change to
    a historical-parity arm and it is not in this one.

    the shell hashes each build directory's `*.c`, `*.h` AND `Makefile`, while
    the Python read only `*.c` and `*.h` there. Editing `objstore/Makefile` --
    which changes how that module builds -- moved the shell hash and not the

    missing from the Python side, and the Makefiles were still missing after it
    was fixed.

    WHY THIS IS A STATIC SCAN AND NOT A BEFORE/AFTER RUN. I wrote the behavioural
    version first: fingerprint the tree, run the suite, fingerprint again. It
    CANNOT CATCH THIS DEFECT. The probe was created and `rm -f`'d inside the same

    concurrently instead would make the arm racy -- it would pass whenever the
    timing missed. So the observable property is the one in the source: no part
    directs a write at the live tree.

    ITS LIMIT, stated because I have spent today objecting to guards that catch
    one spelling: this recognises a redirection whose target mentions the tree
    root variables the parts actually use. A write reaching the tree by some other
    route -- a `cp` destination, a path assembled elsewhere -- would evade it. The

    The shell sorted its manifest with `sort -z`, which uses LOCALE COLLATION,

    fingerprinted differently depending on whose machine it was:

        LC_ALL=C            6d122a7158d5
        LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8  0b59bd75fa4f

    en_US.UTF-8 is a common desktop default. A developer stamping a tree there
    and a CI runner reading it under C.UTF-8 disagree, and the disagreement is a
    FATAL naming a stale binary against a tree that is perfectly clean -- the
    exact false FATAL this controller exists to prevent, arriving from the
    environment rather than from the source.

    The filenames matter: `_` and `-` are what the two collations order
    differently, and `columnar_arrow.c` beside `columnar-arrow.c` is not a
    contrived pair in this tree.
