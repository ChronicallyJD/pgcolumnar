"""The matrix must reconcile the suites it registered against the ones that accounted.

`run_all_versions.sh` prints "suites that ran: N of M" and never checks it, and twelve
registered suites exit 0 without ever calling `pgc_summary`. Measured with a pattern
tight enough to exclude `portlib.sh` -- a looser one matched it and gave both reviewers
of this change the same wrong answer: **none** of the twelve sources `test/lib.sh`.
Each defines its own `check()`, and ten keep no tally at all, so the harness cannot see
their checks. Counted among the suites that
"ran", they are the overcount #447 added that line to stop, one level further down.

A count cannot close this. Two errors of opposite sign cancel, and an exempt list
maintained by hand makes the count agree by construction. So membership is derived
from a property each suite carries -- its own text calls `pgc_summary`, and its log
carries the `accounting:` line `pgc_summary` prints before every exit path -- and the
two readings are reconciled as SETS, in both directions.

These tests drive the SHELL functions out of `run_all_versions.sh` rather than
reimplementing them in Python. A Python twin would be a second implementation and
would agree with itself; the house rule asks for two observers of one implementation.
