"""The classifier's own controls, in the file the gate actually runs (#432).

WHY THIS FILE IS SEPARATE FROM `test_harness_deps.py`, which defines the classifier
it tests. That file is classified cluster-bound -- correctly, because it hands real
cluster-bound file names to pytest in a subprocess -- so the `pytest (harness guards,
no database)` job, whose file list IS `NO_CLUSTER`, never ran it. The classifier that
decides the job's contents was therefore the one thing the job could not check.

@linuxhikerpm measured the consequence: disabling transitive conftest-fixture closure
left shell selftest 350 green and every CI-selected test passing, and only the
excluded targeted test failed. A load-bearing branch could break with both real gates
green.

These arms drive a corpus they write in `tmp_path` and read nothing from the real
tree, so they need no database and this file is declared in `NO_CLUSTER`. It imports
the classifier as a LIBRARY, which does not make it cluster-bound: the propagation
rule reads string constants naming corpus files, not imports.
