"""A raised database error must name WHICH error, and the block must hold one statement.

`VACUITY_MODES.md` section 3.4 listed `raises-too-broad` and `raises-catches-setup`
together, and the measurement that opened this file shows why they belong together.
Run on unmodified main at de8fca4, with the layer loaded and nothing skipped:

    with pytest.raises(psycopg.Error):
        conn = psycopg.connect("host=/nonexistent-socket-dir dbname=pgc")
        conn.execute("SELECT pgc_definitely_no_such_function()")
    expect.num(1, 1, "the server rejected the call")

reported `2 passed`, exit 0. The error that satisfied the claim was
`OperationalError` with `sqlstate` None -- it never reached a server, and the
statement the test is about never executed. Against a live PostgreSQL 18.4 the same
shape raised `InvalidName` 42602 from the SETUP line while the statement under test
raises `UndefinedObject` 42704: two different SQLSTATEs satisfy one `raises`.

So there are two properties, and each needs its own arm:

  1. a broad family must be narrowed to a SQLSTATE -- `psycopg.Error` covers 254 of
     them across 42 SQLSTATE classes, measured against psycopg 3.3.5;
  2. the block must hold exactly one statement, or nothing says which one raised.

THE TWO PROPERTIES CLOSE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS, and that asymmetry is the reason the
last three arms exist. Property 1 CLOSES `raises-too-broad`: a broad family with
nothing pinned cannot be collected. Property 2 only MITIGATES
`raises-catches-setup`, because it counts TOP-LEVEL statements: a call to a helper
that performs the setup is one statement, and so is a `for` holding the setup and
the statement under test. `test_a_helper_hiding_the_setup_is_refused` and
`test_a_compound_statement_hiding_the_setup_is_refused` assert this scan
reports NOTHING on those two shapes, which is why `raises-catches-setup` stays in
`VACUITY_MODES.md` section 3.4 rather than moving to section 2.

THE SCAN IS AST, NOT A LINE REGEX, and this file is the reason. Every arm below
writes the forbidden shape inside a `pytester.makepyfile` string, because that is
how the layer's own tests drive an inner run. A line regex fires on this file and
refuses it -- the false positive the broad-except scan already paid for once.
`test_the_raises_scan_reads_code_not_a_string_literal` pins that.
