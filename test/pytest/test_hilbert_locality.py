"""Port of test/hilbert_locality.sh: does the Hilbert curve buy range locality?

BLOCKED ON #897. THIS FILE CANNOT RUN ON main.

The harness it is written against -- `conftest.py`, `pgc_vacuity.py`,
`pgc_cluster.py`, `pytest.ini` -- lives only on the branch of pull request #897,
which is NOT MERGED and currently has changes requested. `test/pytest/` does not
exist on main, so on main this file has no `expect` fixture, no `pgc_cluster`
fixture and no vacuity plugin, and pytest will fail at collection. It is
committed here so that the port exists and can be reviewed beside the bash
suite; it becomes runnable when #897 lands, and not before.

It was RUN against #897 head 5f3dedb, which merges cleanly with this branch,
in a scratch worktree on PostgreSQL 18.4: 18 passed, 3.20s on a warm tree. The eight pins below came out
identical to the bash suite's, from a different harness and a different way of
reading the counters -- 241/118, 351/209, 588/402, 1624/1313, and z/h of
2.0424, 1.6794, 1.4627, 1.2369.

    pytest --pg-config .../bin/pg_config --pgc-expect-tests 18 \
           test_hilbert_locality.py

AND THE BLOCKING DEPENDENCY IS WIDER THAN test/pytest/. #897 also adds
`pgc_build_and_install` to test/lib.sh, which `pgc_cluster.build_and_install`
drives. With this file dropped beside #897's test/pytest/ but main's lib.sh, the
session ends before any test runs:

    RuntimeError: pgcolumnar failed to build or install from ...
    bash: line 1: pgc_build_and_install: command not found

So "blocked on #897" means the whole of #897, not only the directory.

ONE THING THIS FILE CANNOT DO THAT ITS BASH TWIN DOES, AND IT IS MEASURED

The bash suite REFUSES to report a ratio when the two partitions are not
different: the sixteen measurement arms print UNRUN and pgc_summary counts
them as a third state, "16 unrunnable"; with nothing else red the suite exits
67, INCOMPLETE. Here the same refusal goes
through `expect.cannot_run("UNMET_PRECONDITION", ...)`, and the layer records
the third state but nothing reports it. The mechanism is one line:
`cannot_run` sets `self.unrunnable` and calls `self._counted()`, and
`pytest_runtest_call` asks only whether `rec.count == 0` -- so DECLARING A TEST
UNRUNNABLE MAKES IT PASS. Measured against that head, with the fixture
mutated to lay BOTH arms out with cluster(): "1 failed, 17 passed", and all
four test_groups_read_over_sixty_placements cases were among the greens while
asserting nothing about groups read. Only test_the_two_partitions_differ
reddened, and it reddened for its own reason.

The suite is still red overall, so nothing ships silently; but a reader
counting greens counts four that never asked their question, and DO NOT READ
THIS FILE AS CARRYING THE BASH SUITE'S REFUSAL until the layer converts an
unrunnable record into a non-pass outcome and a non-zero session exit -- the
pytest equivalent of PGC_EXIT_INCOMPLETE=67. That is a change to #897, not to
this file.

WHAT THIS IS A PORT OF, AND WHAT IT IS FOR

test/hilbert_locality.sh builds one fixture, lays it out twice -- once with
pgcolumnar.cluster() (Z-order) and once with pgcolumnar.cluster_hilbert() --
and counts the engine's own "Columnar Chunk Groups Read" over 60 deterministic
window placements at each of four window sizes. Read that file first: its
header carries the reasoning, the three defects the shape exists to avoid, the
account of which arm catches which regression, and the list of things the
measurement does NOT claim.

HOW FAITHFUL THE PORT IS, MEASURED RATHER THAN CLAIMED

Every assertion here carries the bash check's name string verbatim, prefixes
included, so `test/pytest/compare_to_bash.py` can diff the two by property. RUN
ON THIS PAIR IT STILL EXITS 1: 30 bash checks, 30 distinct names on this side,
13 reported missing. None of the 13 is a property this file fails to assert,
and both reasons are worth knowing before trusting the comparator:

  1. ELEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN INTERPOLATE A SHELL VARIABLE. The comparator reads
     SOURCE literals, so bash's "box $box: ..." can never equal this file's
     f-string "box {box}: ...", and crun's one literal, "premise: $1 ran
     without raising", stands for six runtime names. The names the two
     harnesses PRINT are identical; the source literals cannot be.
  2. THE OTHER TWO ARE THE COMPARATOR'S OWN EXTRACTOR. It is a regular
     expression that takes the FIRST string literal in an expect() call and
     stops at the first closing parenthesis. For expect.text(got, WANT, NAME)
     the first literal is the expected TEXT, so the comparator reports
     "different" and "IDENTICAL" as assertion names and calls the two arms
     behind them missing. The same shape makes it report "Columnar Usable Skip
     Predicates" and "Columnar Chunk Groups Total" as names.

Taking the bash prefixes verbatim took the missing count from 27 to 23, and
hoisting nested calls out of the expect() arguments -- so the extractor has a
clear shot at the name -- took it from 23 to 13. Closing the rest is a change
to compare_to_bash.py -- parse with `ast`, take the LAST string-literal
argument of each expect() call, and compare interpolated names after expansion
-- and that file belongs to #897. Until it lands, "the two can be compared
mechanically" is an aspiration, not a fact about this pair.

WHAT THIS PORT DOES NOT CLAIM

It does not claim the two harnesses agree by construction. They agree because
both were run and both produced 241/118, 351/209, 588/402 and 1624/1313 -- and
if one day they disagree, that disagreement is the finding, not a merge
conflict to resolve by editing one of them.

THREE MECHANISMS DIFFER FROM THE BASH ARM, ON PURPOSE

  1. THE COUNTERS ARE READ AS TYPED JSON, NOT GREPPED. The bash suite runs
     EXPLAIN in text and pulls integers out with sed. Here it is
     `EXPLAIN (..., FORMAT JSON)`, which psycopg hands back as parsed Python, so
     "Columnar Chunk Groups Read" is a key holding an int. A regex that matched
     the wrong line, or that matched nothing and yielded the empty string, is
     not a failure mode this arm has.

  2. THE COLUMNAR-SCAN PREMISE GOES THROUGH expect.plan_marker, not a grep for
     a node name. `Custom Plan Provider == "PgColumnarScan"` is NOT the same
     question: the vectorized aggregate node reuses the scan's registered
     methods and reports the same provider, so that predicate says yes for a
     plan with no columnar scan in it. `plan_marker` asks for the
     "Columnar Projected Columns" key, which only the scan's explain callback
     emits -- the faithful port of `pgc_is_columnar_scan`.

  3. THE FIXTURE IS BUILT ONCE PER MODULE, not once per test. It is 200,000
     rows and six clustering operations. See the note on `locality` below for
     what that costs in isolation and why it is still the right trade.

# THE PRIVATE IMPORT IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS A GAP, NOT A PREFERENCE.

# The vacuity layer walks an EXPLAIN JSON tree in `_plan_nodes`, and exposes no
# public way to READ a counter out of one -- `plan_marker` asserts a key is
# present and `plan_node` returns a node matched by type or provider, but this
# suite's whole subject is the VALUE under "Columnar Chunk Groups Read". The
# alternatives were to reimplement the traversal (a second copy of the tree
# shape, free to drift from the layer's) or to import the layer's own. Importing
