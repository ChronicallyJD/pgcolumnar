/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pgcolumnar_projection.c
 *		DDL for multiple physical projections (gap 26, format 2.2).
 *
 * A projection is a named, ordered subset of a table's columns stored as its
 * own columnar storage, sorted on its sort key, sharing the table's row-number
 * identity space (the C-Store model; see design/gaps/26-*). The catalog
 * (pgcolumnar.projection) and the add/drop DDL are provided here: declaring a
 * projection allocates its storage id, records the catalog row, and back-fills
 * the projection's storage from existing rows (PgColumnarBackfillProjection). Read
 * paths (read_projection, reconstruct_via_projection) are also provided.
 *
 * projection_id 0 is the implicit base projection (all live columns, insert
 * order). A table with no pgcolumnar.projection rows has a single implicit base
 * projection, so pre-existing and 2.0/2.1 tables are unaffected. The base row is
 * recorded lazily the first time a projection is added.
 *
 * Written fresh for pgColumnar; it does not reuse any upstream file.

 * reasons. The old rows are already gone on the TRUNCATE path. And a rewrite can
 * change the relation's shape: ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN with a volatile
 * default rewrites AND adds a column, and the base projection records all live

 * stale column set. Resolving names against the relation as it is now gets both
 * cases right for the same reason.
 *
 * Not called from pgcolumnar_relation_set_new_filelocator, which is where #887
 * proposed it. That callback cannot do this job: a rewriting ALTER TABLE reaches
 * it on the TRANSIENT relation make_new_heap builds, with no columnar fork and a
 * different oid, so neither the old storage id nor the projection list is ever
 * in scope. Measured on 18.4 with the callback logging its own relid: TRUNCATE
